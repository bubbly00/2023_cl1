## College Lab Assignments Repository

This repository contains my lab assignments for Machine Learning (ML), Data Modeling and Visualization(DMV), and Information Retrieval (IR) courses at SPPU. Each assignment is organized in its respective folder within this repository.

## Subjects

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: This section contains assignments related to ML concepts and techniques. You can find detailed descriptions and code solutions in the `ml-assignments` folder.

- **Data Modeling and Visualization(DMV)**: The `dmv-assignments` folder includes assignments related to data modeling and visualization. You can explore the solutions and reports for each assignment here.

- **Information Retrieval (IR)**: For assignments related to IR, navigate to the `ir-assignments` folder. It includes information retrieval concepts, implementations, and reports.

## Getting Started

Each assignment folder contains a detailed README file with instructions on how to run and understand the code. You can find helpful resources, datasets, and any special setup requirements within each assignment's README.
