    "### Tackling Noise with Error Correction\n",
    "This Python script demonstrates the implementation of error correction techniques to tackle noise in quantum circuits using Qiskit, a quantum computing framework for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by creating a 5-qubit Quantum Circuit (qc). It then sets up a Noise Model to simulate the effects of noise in a quantum channel. The noise model includes a depolarizing error, with a specified probability (p_error), applied to basic quantum gates ('u1', 'u2', 'u3'). Additionally, a specific X error is introduced to qubit 2 as an example of a corrected gate specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum circuit is then configured to measure all qubits (qc.measure_all()). Then it proceeds to transpile the circuit for simulation on a noisy quantum simulator provided by Aer. The execution of the noisy circuit is performed using the execute function, considering the defined noise model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results of the simulation are obtained, and the counts of different measurement outcomes are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as a practical illustration of how quantum error correction techniques can be implemented using Qiskit to mitigate the impact of noise on quantum computations."
